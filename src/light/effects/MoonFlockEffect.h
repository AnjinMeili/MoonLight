/// A flock with a boid for each piano key: played keys glow and grow, the drums flash, the hottest key hunts, and now and then the flock becomes a spectrum.

/// ## Heat and the predator
///
/// A key played heats its boid, drawn bigger and brighter, and the boid cools again as the key rests. The key heated past the threshold becomes the one predator: a disc with a mouth, two lights in radius at the least, swelling, brightening and opening wide with the bass.
///
/// ## The drums
///
/// A drum hit flashes the boids of the keys in its range, a harder hit bigger and longer: the kick to C#3, the snare to C#7, the hats above. Only the keys played heat a boid, so only they make the predator.
///
/// ## The keyboard
///
/// Now and then the boids fly to their keys along an edge or around a ring and become a spectrum, each bar as tall as its key's band is loud. After the hold a bass hit, or a longer wait, releases them: each bar shrinks back to its boid at the flock's pace, and the boids fly off.
///
/// @technical
///
/// ## On Flock's boids
///
/// The steering is Craig Reynolds' boids in [boids.h](../../../src/light/powerfunctions/boids.h), the same as @ref FlockEffect. A key's heat cools by half-life on the effect's clock, so `fade` is the same at any `speed`; a hot boid sized to a grid of about 40 lights or less stays one light and only brightens.
///
/// The predator's slot takes `trigger` to enter and half of it to leave, so a key at the threshold holds its place. The keyboard forms by Reynolds' arrival, with the force and slowing distance of Aurora's Boid.
///
/// Boids move and bars shrink only in steps, while the timers run on the effect's clock from the first tick, so `speed` 0 holds the picture and the timers run on.
///
/// ## The spectrum
///
/// The bars read the third-octave bands, the bars the Spectrum effect draws, since the semitone bank behind the keys answers slower and stops at 2.5 kHz. A third spans four semitones, so about four neighboring keys share a band.
///
/// A frame that carries only the sixteen bands, from audio sync, draws from those, each a third. A bar rises with its band at once and falls with a 150 ms half-life, as a meter does. The drums split the keys by the same bands, as the core's `rangeOfThird` does.
